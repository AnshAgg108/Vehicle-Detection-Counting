# Vehicle-Detection-Counting
In this project, we developed a system to detect and count vehicles using the OpenCV computer vision library in Python. This solution leverages classical image processing techniques to monitor and analyze traffic in real-time, offering valuable insights for various applications. Our key responsibilities included implementing the vehicle detection and counting system using Python and OpenCV, processing video frames to extract and count moving vehicles by utilizing background subtraction, Gaussian blurring, morphological operations, and contour detection, and calculating vehicle counts based on objects crossing a predefined line in the video frames. The technologies used in this project were Python and the OpenCV library.

The practical applications of this project are vast. It can be used for traffic monitoring by providing real-time data collection on vehicle counts in specific areas, aiding in traffic management and planning. Additionally, it can assist in environmental monitoring by tracking vehicle numbers to estimate and manage air pollution and emissions, and enhance safety and security by providing accurate vehicle counts in critical areas. The project had a significant impact by improving efficiency through better resource allocation and traffic flow management, providing data-driven insights for optimizing transportation and environmental policies, and enhancing road safety by monitoring and managing traffic congestion.

OpenCV, the Open Source Computer Vision Library, is a cross-platform library designed for real-time computer vision. It is known for its efficiency and ease of integration into other programming environments, making it a popular choice for image processing tasks. The library can be downloaded from OpenCV.
